# Capitalism, but upside down 
You find a meaningful thing first, than you start a sustainable non-profit website/app/client/business around it, and then you doing a sh## load of money with doing good deeds. (because best product/service in town, for real, not by media propagation)
<br><br><br>

# What if every enterprise and every individual would turn to the non-profit model, focusing on the purpose, while having the same or even more profit?
#### When a for-profit business converts to a nonprofit, its mission changes dramatically, because a for-profit business runs its operations primarily to make a profit.
#### But when you operate a nonprofit, making a profit cannot be your main purpose any longer.
#### And that it’s mandatory for a non-profit to run their business, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone, is common sense to me.
<br><br><br>
 

# What if individuals could benefit from the flexibility in finding a Paid Volunteering job?
#### Paid Volunteering, which sounds counterintuitive first, is pretty much one of the primary keys to a future without unemployment…
#### Important social and sustainable tasks are deployed as spontaneous jobs to a network of available people.
#### This enables flexible recruitment and release, with a focus on the task, and is a time and resource saver compared to permanent employment.
#### The Paid Volunteer in turn has a huge range of options (jobs) each day, which he can choose from by his personal preference and not by what is paid for, because every job is paid the same.
#### Did you know? Before Corona, the worldwide unemployment was “just” 5% (around 400 million people are unemployed), but is thought to increase because of Corona.
#### If Paid Volunteering was already established, unemployment would have gone down to almost zero, because for Paid Volunteering, bad times are good times, there is an increased demand for the workforce.
#### But if times are good, Paid Volunteering has the potential to maintain the positive structures that are causing the good overall state.

# What if every sustainable action of enterprises and the people would raise a Global Unconditional Basic Income? (UBI)
#### In the past centuries, we as a species were living, as earning profit was the sole meaningful goal in life, superseding all other endeavors.
#### But the acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.
#### “Let’s not wait for the government, we the people are the solution and can drive massive change. We’re talking about how we can move from rebellion to restoration.” Clare Dubois, Tree Sisters

### So at the end, the question is:

## Why not?
